Hi!

I just wanted to say that I'm really bad and pathetic.
I couldn't finish this on my first attempt and had to get help from video tutorials.
to be honest, I expected more from myself.
I'm new to all this. always liked web design and web dev but never started learning until recently.
I hope that it's not that late.
I'm really lazy and procrastinate a lot but I will not give up on this and myself(I hope).
I know I shouldn't write this stuff here but I needed to tell these somewhere.
promise to write a proper readme next time.
